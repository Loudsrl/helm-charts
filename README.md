# LOUDsrl Helm Charts

https://loudsrl.github.io/helm-charts

## Usage

Install [Helm](https://helm.sh) if you donâ€™t already have it.

Add the LOUDsrl chart repository:

```bash
helm repo add loudsrl https://loudsrl.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

Search for available charts:

```bash
helm search repo loudsrl
```

Install a chart:

```bash
helm install my-<release-name> loudsrl/<chart-name>
```

Uninstall a release:

```bash
helm uninstall my-<release-name>
```

## Setup

The `index.yaml` file is automatically generated by GitHub Actions on every push to the main branch. It will be published to the `gh-pages` branch only.

To remove old chart versions from the repo:

- Delete the corresponding [GitHub Release](https://github.com/Loudsrl/helm-charts/releases).

The index will be regenerated without those versions on the next publish.
